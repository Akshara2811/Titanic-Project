1.  Who were the passengers on the Titanic? (Age, gender, class,... etc.) 
2. What deck were the passengers on and how does that relate to their class? 
3. Where did the passengers come from? 
4. Who was alone and who was with family? and various such questions and factors for sinking and surviving the crash. 
All these questions have been explained with the help of data visualization using Python.
